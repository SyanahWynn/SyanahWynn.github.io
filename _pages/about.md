<strong>Introduction</strong><br>
I am a cognitive neuroscientist, studying brain activity in people, often while they perform computer-based tasks in a laboratory setting. To perform these tasks, people need to use specific cognitive functions, like memory and decision-making. In this way I can investigate the brain activity involved in these functions. Most of my work had focused on the brain processes involved in <b>memory-related decision-making and optimal learning</b>. For instance, what determines the confidence we have in our memories: Why are some memories strong and vivid, while others are weak and vague? But also, how do we inhibit irrelevant processes and adapt after making mistakes to optimize our learning? The main method I use to study brain activity is electroencephalography (EEG). In an EEG recording, a cap fitted with small electrodes is placed on a personâ€™s head, allowing brain signals to be measured. For the manipulation of brain activity I use harmless brain stimulation techniques, which work in various ways. For instance, some non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) methods work by using a very small electrical currents to slightly increase or decrease brain activity.<br>

<strong>Background</strong><br>
After a bachelor's in Psychology at Leiden University and a research master's in Cognitive Neuropsychology at VU Amsterdam, I started my PhD in 2015 at the Donders Institute. With Dennis Schutter, Sander Daselaar, Marc Hendriks, and Roy Kessels, I did research on the role of the parietal cortex in memory confidence, using EEG, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) and transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) (<a href="https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/216190/216190.pdf">Dissertation</a>). During my time at the Donders Institute, I also collaborated on projects that focused on attention, decision making, and movement, using EEG, TMS and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Thereafter, I worked as a postdoctoral research associate at Bowdoin College with Erika Nyhus. My work there focused on the role of specific oscillations in brain networks underlying memory retrieval, utilizing EEG and tACS. Then I moved to Ole Jensen's Neural Oscillations group at the University of Birmingham, examining how the brain accomplishes rapid object recognition, using magnetoencephalography (MEG). I subsequently worked in the Til Ole Bergmann group at the Johannes Gutenberg University Medical Center in Mainz, conducting DFG-funded research on the role of the parietal cortex in memory-related decision-making, utilizing concurrent EEG and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). I am currently working at Boehringer Ingelheim, using computational methods to accelerate the drug discovery process.
