I am very happy to announce  that I have received the <a href="https://brainbox-initiative.com/news/2022/young-investigator-award-winner-2022">Young Investigator Award from the Brainbox Initiative</a>! 
This award has been given to me for the work I have done on memory-related decision-making at the <a href="https://www.ru.nl/donders/">Donders Institute</a> and <a href="https://www.bowdoin.edu/">Bowdoin College</a>. 
I got the opportunity to give a talk the Brainbox Initiative Conference and meet a lot of new people. It is really an honour and I am happy to have become a part of the Brainbox community ðŸ˜„.
