I had the pleasure to visit professor <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/tunnelatkist">Hyungmin Kim's lab</a> and giving a syposium at the <a href="https://eng.kist.re.kr/eng/index.do">Korea Institute of Science and Technology (KIST)</a>. I was shown around the lab where I spoke with various students and researchers about their research. I was also greatful to have been invited to give a symposium on my work on memory-related decision-making.
