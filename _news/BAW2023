This weekend we hosted our <a href="https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/research/centre-for-human-brain-health/events/2023/brain-awareness-week-2023.aspx">Brain Awareness event</a>, that was funded by our Dana/FENS grant. Researchers form the University of Birmingham gathered at the Midlands Arts Centre to inform the visitors from the general audience about the cognitive neuroscientific research we do. We had arts and crafts for the kids, a display of 3D models of MEG and MRI machines, information sheets, illusions, and experiments set-up. It was a great success and will hopefully have increased the brain awareness of the people in Birmingham. ðŸ˜Š
