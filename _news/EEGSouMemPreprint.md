My the preprint to my new paper <b>The role of theta and gamma oscillations in item memory, source memory, and memory confidence</b>, can be found on <a href="https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.10.18.562880">BioRxiv</a>!

Me and my co-authors Chris Townsend and Erika Nyhus investigated the unique contibution of theta and gamma oscillations in various memory processes. Both theta and gamma oscillations have been linked to memory processes, but their unique contribution to item memory, source memory, and memory confidence had not been investigated. "By 'item memory,' we refer to the memory of separate elements, and by 'source memory,' we mean the memory of an element and its context. Our participants performed a memory task while we recorded their brain activity (<i>with electroencephalography (EEG)</i>). With the use of regression-based models we predicted brain activity in two specific frequency bands (<i>theta</i>) and (<i>gamma</i>) from memory performance. Our results indicate that theta and gamma brain waves (oscillations) are linked to both memory accuracy and confidence. However, whereas theta oscillations seem to primarily play a role in memory-related confidence, gamma oscillations appear to have multiple functions in memory-processing, dependent on brain area.
