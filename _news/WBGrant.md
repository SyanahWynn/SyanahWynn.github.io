I am delighted to share that I obtained funding from the  <a href="https://www.dfg.de/">Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG)</a> to realize my research project "The causal role of parietal theta oscillations in Angular Gyrus and Hippocampus communication during memory retrieval". Very exciting to be working on this project in 2023!
