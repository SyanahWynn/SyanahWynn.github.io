My new paper <b>The role of theta and gamma oscillations in item memory, source memory, and memory confidence</b>, can be found at <a href="https://doi.org/10.1162/imag_a_00429">Imaging Neuroscience</a>!

My co-authors, Tom Marshall and Erika Nyhus, and I used non-invasive brain stimulation (NIBS) to enhance the confidence we have in our memories. Rhythmic brain waves have been linked to memory processes, but are they truly influencing memory directly? To address this question, our participants performed a memory task while we stimulated their brains (<i>using transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS)</i>) and recorded their brain activity (<i>using electroencephalography (EEG)</i>). TACS works by stimulating brain waves at specific frequencies (4 Hz and 50 Hz in our study) in targeted brain areas, specifically the right frontal (<i>dorsolateral prefrontal cortex</i>) and left posterior (<i>posterior parietal cortex</i>) regions. Our results indicate that stimulating the brain in this way altered memory confidence and that an individual's response to stimulation could be predicted from their brain activity prior to stimulation.
