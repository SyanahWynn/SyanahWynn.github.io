With the Grua/Oâ€™Connell Fund grant, she will be investigating when and how unwanted memories are successfully controlled. Her research is part of a multicentre study that will assess the replicability of the think/no-think (TNT) effect. In the TNT task, participants are asked to supress certain memories. It has been proposed that this leads to forgetting of those supressed memories, but the literature has not been consistent. In this multicentre study, the replicability of this effect will be assessed across various institutes and participant populations.
